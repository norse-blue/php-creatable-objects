# Release 1.0.1

Interface method signature hotfix.

## Changed :slot_machine:

- Make it obvious (enforce) that the `Creatable::create` method accepts variadic parameters.  
_**Note:** :boom: Although being a potential BC change it won't be marked as such as we consider this a bug in the first place._
